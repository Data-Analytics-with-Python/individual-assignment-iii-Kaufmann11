-2pt: In Q1(i), you should have dropped the 'ID' column in the features

-5pt: In Q1(iii), should not included "ID" in the new data, as such info in not predictive for the spending. Also the "response" variable is not given for the new customer; so both possibilities need to be considered.

-4pt: In Q1(iv), did not comment on the performance measures.

-3pts: In Q1 (v), "cv=6" does not shuffle data by default, potentially leading to issues

-2pts: In Q1 (vi), the CV does not shuffle data

-2pts: In Q2 (i), did not comment on the comparison between linear regression and random forest.

-5pts: In Q2 (ii), did not explain the plot

-7pts: In Q3 (iii), did not explain the measures


-2pt codes have redundancy/repetition. For example, there are repetitive codes for constructing features and target, dropping n/a, etc.
